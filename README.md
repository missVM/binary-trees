# Binary Tree Project README

## Overview

This project is a collaborative effort by [Your Name] and [Your Teammate's Name] to explore and implement various aspects of binary trees in C. The goal of this project is to deepen our understanding of binary trees, their properties, and the operations that can be performed on them.

## Project Description

In this project, we will work with binary trees, a fundamental data structure in computer science. Our project will cover various topics related to binary trees, including their structure, traversal methods, and properties like depth, height, and size.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, we aim to achieve the following learning objectives:

- Understand what a binary tree is and how it differs from other data structures.
- Differentiate between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree (BST).
- Identify the potential gains in terms of time complexity when using binary trees compared to linked lists.
- Define and calculate the depth, height, and size of a binary tree.
- Implement different traversal methods for binary trees.
- Recognize different types of binary trees, such as complete, full, perfect, and balanced trees.

## Requirements

### General

- **Editors:** You are allowed to use `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs` for editing your code.
- **Compilation:** Your code will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with the following options: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- **File Formatting:** Ensure that all your source code files end with a new line.
- **README.md:** Create a `README.md` file at the root of your project folder. This file is mandatory and should provide an overview of your project.
- **Coding Style:** Your code should follow the Betty style, which will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- **Global Variables:** Do not use global variables in your code.
- **Function Limit:** Each source file should contain no more than 5 functions.
- **Standard Library:** You are allowed to use the standard C library.
- **Header Files:** The prototypes of all your functions should be included in a header file named `binary_trees.h`.
- **Header File Guard:** Make sure to include header file guards in all your header files.

### Repository Guidelines

- **GitHub:** There should be one project repository per group. Cloning, forking, or duplicating a project repository with the same name before the second deadline may result in a 0% score.

## Data Structures

Please use the following data structures and types for binary trees and include them in your `binary_trees.h` header file:

- `struct binary_tree_s`: A basic binary tree node with fields for an integer value, parent, left child, and right child.
- `typedef struct binary_tree_s binary_tree_t`: Used for simple binary trees.
- `typedef struct binary_tree_s bst_t`: Used for Binary Search Trees (BST).
- `typedef struct binary_tree_s avl_t`: Used for AVL Trees.
- `typedef struct binary_tree_s heap_t`: Used for Max Binary Heaps.

## Implementation

The project consists of multiple tasks related to binary trees. You are required to implement solutions for these tasks to meet the learning objectives.

### Print Function

A print function is provided for visualization purposes. You don't need to include it in your repository, as it may not be used during the correction.

## Copyright and Plagiarism

You are responsible for creating solutions for the project tasks to meet the learning objectives. Copying and pasting someone else's work or any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and may result in removal from the program.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, clone this repository to your local machine and start working on the tasks in accordance with the project requirements.
